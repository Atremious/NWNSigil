<h2>NWN Module Packing/Unpacking Utilities</h2>

<p><i>Note: These tools require Java to run.  I've only tested it on
	  Java 1.4 and above.  Go <a href="http://javasoft.com/">here</a>
	  and download the latest J2SE if you don't already have Java
	  installed.</i></p>

<p><i>Also Note: This is currently alpha software, which for me means
	  that it should theoretically work but I've only tested it
	  on a handful of modules.  So, make sure to keep backups of
	  your work... just in case.  Good advice anyway.</i></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>ModPacker/ModUnpacker</h4>

<p>Included are two simple tools that will pack and unpack module
files.  This is similar to what the Neverwinter Nights toolset
will do, but alot faster and command line driven.</p>

<p>I wrote these tools for when I'm editing the scripts of a large
module.  It can be quite painful to save a 62+ megabyte module from
the Bioware toolset every time I make a minor change to a script.  On
my system, the module packer tool will rebuild the module file in about
8 seconds.  The same module takes almost a minute to save with the
toolset.</p>

<p>Combined with Torlack's commandline-based script compiler, I can edit
scripts, build them, and roll them back into a module without ever
having to run the bioware toolset... and I can do it all from the
command line.</p>

<h4>ModToXml/XmlToGff</h4>

<p>Also included are some tools for converting modules and/or their
packed GFF files into XML files and back again.  This makes it easier to
store module "source" files in a CVS repository and collaborate with other
developers.  Sometimes it's a nice way to do quick edits to a file too without
booting up the bioware toolset.<p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Make sure you have Java installed.</p>

<p>Unzip the modpacker.zip file to a directory somewhere.</p>

<p>Run the setup.cmd script that is in this directory.  This script
will create six other scripts called: setpath.cmd, ModPacker.cmd,
ModUnpacker.cmd, ModToXml.cmd, GffToXml.cmd, and XmlToGff.cmd.</p>

<p>Whenever you want to use the tool, run the setpath.cmd to setup
your environment in the command line within which you will be working.
After that, you should be able to run ModPacker, ModUnpacker, etc. from
wherever you want.</p>

<p>You can check your installion by running either ModPacker.cmd or
ModUnpacker.cmd with no arguments.  If things are working correctly,
you should see the simple help message explaining the tool's usage.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;<b>modpacker</b>
Usage: ModPacker &lt;directory&gt; &lt;mod file&gt;

Where: &lt;directory&gt; is the location of the files to pack.
    and &lt;mod file&gt; is the file to create.
</code></pre>

<h3>ModUnpacker</h3>

<p>This will extract the resources from a module file and save them
to a directory.  The Bioware toolset does the same thing when you
open a module, but with ModUnpacker you can specify which directory
to dump the files.</p>

<p>To run, type <code><b>ModUnpacker mymodule.mod mydirectory</b></code>
where <code>mymodule.mod</code> is the name of the module to unpack and
<code>mydirectory</code> is where you want the files dumped.  You must
have already created the directory ahead of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><code><b>ModUnpacker FizWorld.mod testdir</b></code></p>

<p>The above will unpack the FizWorld module and store all of the files
into the directory testdir.</p>

<h3>ModPacker</h3>

<p>This will use the contents of a directory to create a module file.
It will ignore sub-directories and file types it doesn't know how to
deal with.  Other than that, it will try to pack everything so don't
put strange files into the directory.</p>

<p>To run, type <code><b>ModPacker mydirectory mymodule.mod</b></code>
where <code>mymodule.mod</code> is the name of the module you wish to
create and <code>mydirectory</code> is the location of the module
resources you wish to bundle.</p>

<p><font color="red">Note: this tool will happily write over existing
module files without a care.  So be careful and backup your work in
case of mistakes.</font></p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><code><b>ModPacker testdir UpdatedFizWorld.mod</b></code></p>

<p>The above command will repack the module we unpacked in the ModUnpacker
example above.  In the ideal case, if we've made no changes then FizWorld.mod
and FizWorldUpated.mod would be identical except for the internal date stamp.
The size should be the same in any case.</p>

<h3>ModToXml</h3>

<p>This will extract the resources from a module file and save the
GFF-based files as XML representations of the data.  This is similar to the
ModUnpacker utility except that you'll end up with a bunch of XML files
for the .are, .gic, .itp, etc. files.</p>

<p>To run, type <code><b>ModToXml mymodule.mod mydirectory</b></code>
where <code>mymodule.mod</code> is the name of the module to unpack+convert
and <code>mydirectory</code> is where you want the files dumped.  You must
have already created the directory ahead of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><code><b>ModToXml FizWorld.mod xml_testdir</b></code></p>

<p>The above will unpack the FizWorld module and store all of the converted and
copied files into the directory xml_testdir.</p>

<h3>XmlToGff</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, at the time of this release, the only way to get your XML files
back into a module is to convert them to binaries using XmlToGff and then run
ModPacker on them.  So it's a two step process.</p>

<p>Also note, XmlToGff (and GffToXml) has its command line arguments backwards from
what one might expect after using the other tools.  It takes the destination directory
as the first argument and then a list of files for the following arguments.</p>

<p>To run, type <code><b>XmlToGff mydirectory myfiles/*</b></code>
where <code>mydirectory</code> is where you want the converted files to be stored
and myfiles/* is the set of files to be converted.  Non-XML files will simply be
copied.  You must have already created the directory ahead of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><code><b>XmlToGff testdir xml_testdir/*</b></code></p>

<p>The above will convert all of the files in xml_testdir and store them into
the direct testdir... copying any non-xml files as it goes.</p>

<p>From there you could run ModPacker to make a module as:</p>
<p><code><b>ModPacker testdir UpdatedFizWorld.mod</b></code></p>

<h3>GffToXml</h3>

<p>For symmetry, a GFF to XML converter has also been included.  It functions pretty
much the same say that XmlToGff does except in reverse.</p>

<p>To run, type <code><b>GffToXml mydirectory myfiles/*</b></code>
where <code>mydirectory</code> is where you want the converted files to be stored
and myfiles/* is the set of files to be converted.  Non-GFF files will simply be
copied.  You must have already created the directory ahead of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p><code><b>GffToXml xml_testdir testdir/*</b></code></p>

<p>The above will convert all of the files in testdir and store their XML counterparts into
the direct xml_testdir... copying any non-convertable files as it goes.</p>

<h3>Typical XML conversion workflows</h3>

<p>Simple workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Unpack the module as XML and native files.</li>
<p><code><b>ModToXml FizWorld.mod xml_testdir</b></code></p>

<li>Step 2: Edit the XML files as you see fit.</li>
<li>Step 3: Reconvert the files to binaries.</li>
<p><code><b>XmlToGff testdir xml_testdir/*</b></code></p>
<li>Step 4: Repack the module.</li>
<p><code><b>ModPacker testdir UpdatedFizWorld.mod</b></code></p>
</ol>

<p>Advanced workflow (for those that always want the intermediate binaries):</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Unpack the module as native files.</li>
<p><code><b>ModUnpacker FizWorld.mod testdir</b></code></p>
<li>Step 2: Convert the binaries to XML.</li>
<p><code><b>GffToXml xml_testdir testdir/*</b></code></p>
<li>Step 3: Edit the XML files as you see fit.</li>
<li>Step 4: Reconvert the files to binaries.</li>
<p><code><b>XmlToGff testdir xml_testdir/*</b></code></p>
<li>Step 5: Repack the module.</li>
<p><code><b>ModPacker testdir UpdatedFizWorld.mod</b></code></p>
</ol>

<p>The advanced workflow is useful if you are using tools that can determine
when files need to be reconverted and when they don't (like if you're using a build
tool like make or ant).  I think the NWN-tools tools are fast enough that this really
only makes a big difference for extremely large modules... and even then, only if you
find you're repacking frequently.</p>

<h3>Non-windows Users</h3>

<p>All of the above holds true except you may need/want to write your
own shell scripts based on the Windows .cmd script files.</p>

<h3>Preemptive Answers</h3>

<p>A few answers to questions that may be asked.</p>

<p>Q: Who will find these tools useful?<br>
A: Anyone that prefers to do module development outside the Bioware
toolset when possible.</p>

<p>Q: Is the source code available?<br>
A: Yes, most certainly.  See the sourceforge CVS at http://nwntools.sf.net/</p>

<p>Q: Why did you write this in Java instead of &lt;<i>insert super-elite language here</i>&gt;?<br>
A: Because it's the language I use the most and it allowed me to cobble
the original packer/unpacker tools together in a few hours.</p>

<p>Q: Why did the install size grow with this release?<br>
A: Well, with the XML conversion utilities now included I depend on a couple other
projects including <a href="http://meta-jb.sf.net/">Meta-JB</a> and in some cases
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/">Log4j</a>.  I tried to keep it trimmed down though.</p>
